You can contribute by solving any of our open issues, or  any other improvement you feel like doing!
- Fork the repository and clone your fork using git
- Create a new branch for your changes
- Install the dev requirements with `pip3 install -r dev-requirements.txt`
- Run `pre-commit install`. After every commit, pre-commit will use black to format the style of your code, keeping a consistent style for the whole project. If your files get reformatted, your changes(and black's) will stay staged and you'll have to commit again. You can also run `black .` to reformat the files, or `black . --check` to see if there is anything that needs to be reformated.
